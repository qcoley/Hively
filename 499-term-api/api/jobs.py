""" This job runs every five minutes. It updates the air quality values in the database.
I gathered average values for CO, CO2, PM, and humidity from these sites:
CO: https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-average-level-carbon-monoxide-homes#:~:text=Average%20levels%20in%20homes%20without,be%2030%20ppm%20or%20higher.
CO2: https://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/co2-levels-at-home
PM 2.5: https://www.indoorairhygiene.org/pm2-5-explained/
Humidity: https://indoortemp.com/resources/ideal-home-humidity-level-control

I then varied these values randomly within a target range depending on a few things:
Busy time - betwen 6pm - 7pm is the busiest time of day for the family, when the most appliances will be on, they will probably be cooking
and the family will be gathered together breathing a lot.
Apertures open - if any apertures are open, this can significantly affect the concetrations of each of these

CO:
    When its busy more appliances are on so CO is higher
    When apertures are open, CO is lower because it is equalized with the air outisde
CO2:
    When its busy more appliances are on so CO2 is higher and more people are in the house breathing
    When apertures are open, CO2 is lower because it is equalized with the air outisde
PM 2.5:
    Actions the family does don't affect PM that much, so its only slightly raised during busy time but has a higher delta
    When apertures are open, PM is actually higher since the PM of outside air in birmingham is always higher than inse
    This is because birmingham's poor air quality + AC units filtering the air
Humidity:
    When its busy, more hot water is probably being used and more people are breathing, so humidity is higher
    When apertures are open, humidity is equalized withing a very small delta of outside air

""" This is the hvac job. It takes a given time and updates the current temp of the thermostat 
    based off several things:
    1. If the HVAC is on, +- 1 degree/minute until the temp exceeds the target in either direction
    2. Also takes into account outside temp and open apertures
        a. Outside temp changes inside temp by 0.033 degrees * the difference between the outside temp and the inside temp / minute
        b Open apertures calculate in a similar way but with much higher rates of change, 0.4 for doors and 0.2 for windows
    
    It then determines whether its necessary to turn the HVAC on or off.

    This job runs every minute by default and can be called to generate historical data by passing in a date time that isnt current
    This function will be called from the normal event loop if the time is not between 23:59 and 00:00, to avoid issues with event generation
